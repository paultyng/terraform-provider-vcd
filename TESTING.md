# Testing terraform-provider-vcd

In order to test the provider, you can simply run `make test`.

```sh
$ make test
```

In order to run the full suite of Acceptance tests, run `make testacc`.

*Note:* Acceptance tests create real resources, and often cost money to run.

```sh
$ make testacc
```

The acceptance tests will run against your own vCloud Director setup, using the configuration in your file `./vcd/vcd_test_config.json`
See the file `./vcd/sample_vcd_test_config.json` for an example of which variables need to be defined.

Each test in the suite will write a Terraform configuration file inside `./vcd/test-artifacts`, named after the
tests. For example: `vcd.TestAccVcdNetworkDirect.tf`

The test suite will try to minimize the amount of resources to create. If no catalog and vApp 
template (`catalogItem`) are defined in the configuration file, new ones will be created and removed at the end of
the test. You can choose to preserve catalog and vApp template across runs (use the `preserve` field in the
configuration file).

There are several environment variables that can affect the tests:

* `TF_ACC=1` enables the acceptance tests. It is also set when you run `make testacc`.
* `GOVCD_DEBUG=1` enables debug output of the test suite
* `VCD_SKIP_TEMPLATE_WRITING=1` skips the production of test templates into `./vcd/test-artifacts`
* `ADD_PROVIDER=1` Adds the full provider definition to the snippets inside `./vcd/test-artifacts`. 
   **WARNING**: the provider definition includes your vCloud Director credentials.
* `VCD_CONFIG=FileName` sets the file name for the test configuration file.
* `REMOVE_ORG_VDC_FROM_TEMPLATE` is a quick way of enabling an alternate testing mode:
When `REMOVE_ORG_VDC_FROM_TEMPLATE` is set, the terraform
templates will be changed on-the-fly, to comment out the definitions of org and vdc. This will force the test to
borrow org and vcd from the provider.
* `VCD_TEST_SUITE_CLEANUP=1` will clean up testing resources that were created in previous test runs.
