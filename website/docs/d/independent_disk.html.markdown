* `vdc` - (Optional) The name of VDC to use, optional if defined at provider level
* `id` - (Optional) Disk id or name is required. If both provided - Id is used. Id can be found by using import function [Listing independent disk IDs](/docs/providers/vcd/r/independent_disk.html#listing-independent-disk-ids)
