# vcd\_network\_routed

Provides a vCloud Director Org VDC routed Network. This can be used to create,
modify, and delete internal networks for vApps to connect.

Supported in provider *v2.0+*

## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "vcd_network_routed" "net" {
  org = "my-org" # Optional
  vdc = "my-vdc" # Optional

  name         = "my-net"
  edge_gateway = "Edge Gateway Name"
  gateway      = "10.10.0.1"

  dhcp_pool {
    start_address = "10.10.0.2"
    end_address   = "10.10.0.100"
  }

  static_ip_pool {
    start_address = "10.10.0.152"
    end_address   = "10.10.0.254"
  }
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `org` - (Optional; *v2.0+*) The name of organization to use, optional if defined at provider level. Useful when
  connected as sysadmin working across different organisations
* `vdc` - (Optional; *v2.0+*) The name of VDC to use, optional if defined at provider level
* `name` - (Required) A unique name for the network
* `description` - (Optional *v2.6+*) An optional description of the network
* `interface_type` - (Optional *v2.6+*) An interface for the network. One of `internal` (default), `subinterface`, 
  `distributed` (requires the edge gateway to support distributed networks)
* `edge_gateway` - (Required) The name of the edge gateway
* `netmask` - (Optional) The netmask for the new network. Defaults to `255.255.255.0`
* `gateway` (Required) The gateway for this network
* `dns1` - (Optional) First DNS server to use.
* `dns2` - (Optional) Second DNS server to use.
* `dns_suffix` - (Optional) A FQDN for the virtual machines on this network
* `shared` - (Optional) Defines if this network is shared between multiple VDCs
  in the Org.  Defaults to `false`.
* `dhcp_pool` - (Optional) A range of IPs to issue to virtual machines that don't
  have a static IP; see [IP Pools](#ip-pools) below for details.
* `static_ip_pool` - (Optional) A range of IPs permitted to be used as static IPs for
  virtual machines; see [IP Pools](#ip-pools) below for details.

## IP Pools

Static IP Pools and DHCP Pools support the following attributes:

* `start_address` - (Required) The first address in the IP Range
* `end_address` - (Required) The final address in the IP Range

DHCP Pools additionally support the following attribute:

* `max_lease_time` - (Optional) The maximum DHCP lease time to use. Defaults to `7200`.

## Importing

Supported in provider *v2.5+*

~> **Note:** The current implementation of Terraform import can only import resources into the state. It does not generate
configuration. [More information.][docs-import]

An existing routed network can be [imported][docs-import] into this resource via supplying its path.
The path for this resource is made of orgName.vdcName.networkName.
For example, using this structure, representing a routed network that was **not** created using Terraform:

```hcl
resource "vcd_network_routed" "tf-mynet" {
  name              = "my-net"
  org               = "my-org"
  vdc               = "my-vdc"
  edge_gateway      = "COMPUTE"
  gateway           = "COMPUTE"
}
```

You can import such routed network into terraform state using this command

```
terraform import vcd_network_routed.tf-mynet my-org.my-vdc.my-net
```

NOTE: the default separator (.) can be changed using Provider.import_separator or variable VCD_IMPORT_SEPARATOR

[docs-import]:https://www.terraform.io/docs/import/

After importing, if you run `terraform plan` you will see the rest of the values and modify the script accordingly for
further operations.
