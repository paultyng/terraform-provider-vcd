Terraform vCloud Director Provider
==================

The official Terraform provider for [VMware vCloud Director](https://www.vmware.com/products/vcloud-director.html)

- Documentation of the latest binary release available at https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/vcd/index.html
- This project is using [go-vcloud-director](https://github.com/vmware/go-vcloud-director) Golang SDK for making API calls to vCD

Requirements
------------

-	[Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html)
-	[Go](https://golang.org/doc/install) 1.13 (to build the provider plugin)

Building The Provider (the modules way)
--------------------------------------
**Note.** You *only* need to build the provider plugin if you want to *develop* it. Refer to [documentation](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/vcd/) for using it. Terraform will
automatically download officially released binaries of this provider plugin on the first run of
`terraform init` command.

Starting with version 2.1 provider started using [Go modules](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Modules)
This means that it is no longer necessary to be in GOPATH.
[See more](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Modules#how-to-use-modules) on how to use modules
and toggle between modes.

```
$ cd ~/mydir
$ git clone https://github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-vcd.git
$ cd terraform-provider-vcd/
$ make build
```

Building The Provider (the old [vendor](https://golang.org/cmd/go/#hdr-Vendor_Directories) way)
--------------------------------------

Prior to version 2.1 provider used Go vendor directory for dependency management. This method is not recommended
anymore, but can be used to build provider on Go versions < 1.11.

Clone repository to: `$GOPATH/src/github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-vcd`

```sh
$ mkdir -p $GOPATH/src/github.com/terraform-providers; cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/terraform-providers
$ git clone https://github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-vcd.git
```

Enter the provider directory and build the provider

```sh
$ cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-vcd
$ make build
```


Developing the Provider
---------------------------

Starting with terraform-provider-vcd version 2.1 Go modules are used, while `vendor` directory is left for backwards
compatibility only. This means a few things:
* The code no longer needs to stay in your `GOPATH`. It can though -
[see more](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Modules#how-to-use-modules) on how to use modules and toggle between modes.
* `vendor` directory is __not to be changed manually__. Always use Go modules when introducing new dependencies
and always rebuild the vendor directory using `go mod vendor` if you have changed `go.mod` or `go.sum`. Travis CI will
catch and fail if it is not done. **Note** Go 1.13+ must be used for `go mod vendor` as starting with this version
"/vendor" directory structure changed and Travis will fail if "/vendor" is built and commited with Go <1.12.
* When developing `terraform-provider-vcd` one often needs to add extra stuff to `go-vcloud-director`. Go modules
have a convenient [replace](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Modules#when-should-i-use-the-replace-directive)
directive which can allow you to redirect import path to your own version of `go-vcloud-director`.
`go.mod` can be altered:
 * You can replace your import with a forked branch like this:
 ```go
    module github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-vcd/v2
    require (
    	...
    	github.com/vmware/go-vcloud-director/v2 v2.1.0-alpha.2
    	)
    replace github.com/vmware/go-vcloud-director/v2 v2.1.0-alpha.2 => github.com/my-git-user/go-vcloud-director/v2 v2.1.0-alpha.2    
 ```
 * You can also replace pointer to a branch with relative directory
 ```go
     module github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-vcd/v2
     require (
     	...
     	github.com/vmware/go-vcloud-director/v2 v2.1.0-alpha.2
     	)
     replace github.com/vmware/go-vcloud-director/v2 v2.1.0-alpha.2 => ../go-vcloud-director
  ```

See **CODING_GUIDELINES.md** for more advice on how to write code for this project.

Using the provider
----------------------

### Installing the built provider

For a more thorough test using the Terraform client, you may want to transfer the plugin in the Terraform directory. A `make` command can do this for you:

```sh
$ make install
```

This command will build the plugin and transfer it to `$HOME/.terraform.d/plugins`, with a name that includes the version (as taken from the `./VERSION` file).

### Using the new plugin

Once you have installed the plugin as mentioned above, you can simply create a new `config.tf` as defined in [the manual](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/vcd/index.html) and run 

```sh
$ terraform init
$ terraform plan
$ terraform apply
```
