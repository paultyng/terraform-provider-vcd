# vcd\_network\_routed\_v2

Provides a VMware Cloud Director Org VDC routed Network. This can be used to create, modify, and
delete routed VDC networks (backed by NSX-T or NSX-V).

Supported in provider *v3.2+* for both NSX-T and NSX-V VDCs.

## Example Usage (NSX-T backed routed Org VDC network)

```hcl
resource "vcd_network_routed_v2" "nsxt-backed" {
  org         = "my-org"
  vdc         = "my-nsxt-org-vdc"
  name        = "nsxt-routed 1"
  description = "My routed Org VDC network backed by NSX-T"

  edge_gateway_id = data.vcd_nsxt_edgegateway.existing.id

  gateway       = "1.1.1.1"
  prefix_length = 24

  static_ip_pool {
    start_address = "1.1.1.10"
    end_address   = "1.1.1.20"
  }

  static_ip_pool {
    start_address = "1.1.1.100"
    end_address   = "1.1.1.103"
  }
}
```

## Example Usage (NSX-T backed routed Org VDC network and a DHCP pool)

```hcl
resource "vcd_network_routed_v2" "parent-network" {
  name = "nsxt-routed-dhcp"

  edge_gateway_id = data.vcd_nsxt_edgegateway.existing.id

  gateway       = "7.1.1.1"
  prefix_length = 24

  static_ip_pool {
    start_address = "7.1.1.10"
    end_address   = "7.1.1.20"
  }
}

resource "vcd_nsxt_network_dhcp" "pools" {
  org_network_id = vcd_network_routed_v2.parent-network.id

  pool {
    start_address = "7.1.1.100"
    end_address   = "7.1.1.110"
  }

  pool {
    start_address = "7.1.1.111"
    end_address   = "7.1.1.112"
  }
}
```

## Example Usage (NSX-V backed routed Org VDC network using `subinterface` NIC)

```hcl
resource "vcd_network_routed_v2" "nsxv-backed" {
  org         = "my-org"
  vdc         = "my-nsxv-org-vdc"
  name        = "nsxv-routed-network"
  description = "NSX-V routed network"

  interface_type = "subinterface"

  edge_gateway_id = data.vcd_edgegateway.existing.id

  gateway       = "1.1.1.1"
  prefix_length = 24

  static_ip_pool {
    start_address = "1.1.1.10"
    end_address   = "1.1.1.20"
  }
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `org` - (Optional) The name of organization to use, optional if defined at provider level. Useful when
  connected as sysadmin working across different organisations
* `vdc` - (Optional) The name of VDC to use, optional if defined at provider level
* `name` - (Required) A unique name for the network
* `description` - (Optional) An optional description of the network
* `interface_type` - (Optional) An interface for the network. One of `internal` (default), `subinterface`, 
  `distributed` (requires the edge gateway to support distributed networks). NSX-T supports only `internal`
* `edge_gateway_id` - (Required) The ID of the edge gateway (NSX-V or NSX-T)
* `gateway` (Required) The gateway for this network (e.g. 192.168.1.1)
* `prefix_length` - (Required) The prefix length for the new network (e.g. 24 for netmask 255.255.255.0).
* `dns1` - (Optional) First DNS server to use.
* `dns2` - (Optional) Second DNS server to use.
* `dns_suffix` - (Optional) A FQDN for the virtual machines on this network
* `static_ip_pool` - (Optional) A range of IPs permitted to be used as static IPs for
  virtual machines; see [IP Pools](#ip-pools) below for details.

## IP Pools

Static IP Pools support the following attributes:

* `start_address` - (Required) The first address in the IP Range
* `end_address` - (Required) The final address in the IP Range

## Importing

~> **Note:** The current implementation of Terraform import can only import resources into the state. It does not generate
configuration. [More information.][docs-import]

An existing routed network can be [imported][docs-import] into this resource via supplying its path.
The path for this resource is made of orgName.vdcName.networkName.
For example, using this structure, representing a routed network that was **not** created using Terraform:

```hcl
resource "vcd_network_routed_v2" "tf-mynet" {
  name = "my-net"
  org  = "my-org"
  vdc  = "my-vdc"
  # ...
}
```

You can import such routed network into terraform state using this command

```
terraform import vcd_network_routed_v2.tf-mynet my-org.my-vdc.my-net
```

NOTE: the default separator (.) can be changed using Provider.import_separator or variable VCD_IMPORT_SEPARATOR

[docs-import]:https://www.terraform.io/docs/import/

After importing, if you run `terraform plan` you will see the rest of the values and modify the script accordingly for
further operations.
