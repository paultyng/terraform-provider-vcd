## Example Usage

### Connecting as Org Admin

The most common - tenant - use case when you set user to organization administrator and when all resources are in a single organization. 

```hcl
# Configure the VMware Cloud Director Provider
provider "vcd" {
  user                 = var.vcd_user
  password             = var.vcd_pass
  auth_type            = "integrated"
  org                  = var.vcd_org
  vdc                  = var.vcd_vdc
  url                  = var.vcd_url
  max_retry_timeout    = var.vcd_max_retry_timeout
  allow_unverified_ssl = var.vcd_allow_unverified_ssl
}

# Create a new network in organization and VDC defined above
resource "vcd_network_routed" "net" {
  # ...
}
```

### Connecting as Sys Admin

When you want to manage resources across different organizations from a single configuration.

```hcl
# Configure the VMware Cloud Director Provider
provider "vcd" {
  user                 = "administrator"
  password             = var.vcd_pass
  auth_type            = "integrated"
  org                  = "System"
  url                  = var.vcd_url
  max_retry_timeout    = var.vcd_max_retry_timeout
  allow_unverified_ssl = var.vcd_allow_unverified_ssl
}

# Create a new network in some organization and VDC
resource "vcd_network_routed" "net1" {
  org = "Org1"
  vdc = "Org1VDC"

  # ...
}

# Create a new network in a different organization and VDC
resource "vcd_network_routed" "net2" {
  org = "Org2"
  vdc = "Org2VDC"

  # ...
}
```

### Connecting as Sys Admin with Default Org and VDC

When you want to manage resources across different organizations but set a default one. 

```hcl
# Configure the VMware Cloud Director Provider
provider "vcd" {
  user                 = "administrator"
  password             = var.vcd_pass
  auth_type            = "integrated"
  sysorg               = "System"
  org                  = var.vcd_org                  # Default for resources
  vdc                  = var.vcd_vdc                  # Default for resources
  url                  = var.vcd_url
  max_retry_timeout    = var.vcd_max_retry_timeout
  allow_unverified_ssl = var.vcd_allow_unverified_ssl
}

# Create a new network in the default organization and VDC
resource "vcd_network_routed" "net1" {
  # ...
}

# Create a new network in a specific organization and VDC
resource "vcd_network_routed" "net2" {
  org = "OrgZ"
  vdc = "OrgZVDC"

  # ...
}
```

## Connecting with authorization or bearer token

You can connect using an authorization token instead of username and password.

```hcl
provider "vcd" {
  auth_type            = "token"
  token                = var.token
  sysorg               = "System"
  org                  = var.vcd_org                  # Default for resources
  vdc                  = var.vcd_vdc                  # Default for resources
  url                  = var.vcd_url
  max_retry_timeout    = var.vcd_max_retry_timeout
  allow_unverified_ssl = var.vcd_allow_unverified_ssl
}

# Create a new network in the default organization and VDC
resource "vcd_network_routed" "net1" {
  # ...
}
```
When using a token, the fields `user` and `password` will be ignored, but they need to be in the script.

### Shell script to obtain token
To obtain a token you can use this sample shell script:

```sh
#!/bin/bash
user=$1
password=$2
org=$3
IP=$4

if [ -z "$IP" ]
then
    echo "Syntax $0 user password organization hostname_or_IP_address"
    exit 1
fi

options=""
os=$(uname -s)
is_linux=$(echo "$os" | grep -i linux)
if [ -n "$is_linux" ]
then
  options="-w 0"
fi

auth=$(echo -n "$user@$org:$password" |base64 $options)

curl -I -k --header "Accept: application/*;version=32.0" \
    --header "Authorization: Basic $auth" \
    --request POST https://$IP/api/sessions
```

If successful, the output of this command will include lines like the following:

```
X-VCLOUD-AUTHORIZATION: 08a321735de84f1d9ec80c3b3e18fa8b
X-VMWARE-VCLOUD-ACCESS-TOKEN: eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiJ9.eyJzdWIiOiJhZG1pbmlzdHJhdG9yIiwiaXNzIjoiYTkzYzlkYjktNzQ3MS0zMTkyLThkMDktYThmN2VlZGE4NWY5QGY5MDZlODE1LTM0NjgtNGQ0ZS04MmJlLTcyYzFjMmVkMTBiMyIsImV4cCI6MTYwNzUxMjgyOCwidmVyc2lvbiI6InZjbG91ZF8xLjAiLCJqdGkiOiJjY2IwZjIwN2JjY2Y0NmYwYmEwNTcyNzgxZDQyNDg2MyJ9.SMjp5wsSd7CXGMdlj-weeCRdr5AazA74pwwx2w3Eqh3RdzyiEMvQfWQAuPAQjM1oOsEUnFOg2u0gYsnIyQg_p7kzXKPQwPNz3BPi0tm2DxxQtQVhOBRXCqUJ9OmRlMVu7FZZ6gKD4GhpbTkZyKMN_IgOFkkt8iXs1-weNZw5TmyVHeWiJdV0JFM45CV47jQNdQMy4OSsU-CqE2VVLOK83oJhRnlnc3O4OAAIfuVZ4SLWqgi1lIoc2vbZv0HYeWO7L_2pGfmja8CVzVhPrgIGEoDhXnvO29z1ToEXRnyMKh9cisiRkhUISpsh4aHRGUUzaZYeOejVX3PAO9aCX3iYWA

The string after `X-VCLOUD-AUTHORIZATION:` is the old (deprecated) token.
The string after `X-VMWARE-VCLOUD-ACCESS-TOKEN` is the bearer token
```

Either token will grant the same abilities as the account used to run the above script. Note, however, that the deprecated
token may not work in recent VCD versions.

Using a token produced by an org admin to run a task that requires a system administrator will fail.

### Connecting with SAML user using Microsoft Active Directory Federation Services (ADFS) and setting custom Relaying Party Trust Identifier

Take special attention to `user`, `use_saml_adfs` and `saml_rpt_id` fields.

```hcl
# Configure the VMware Cloud Director Provider
provider "vcd" {
  user                 = "test@contoso.com"
  password             = var.vcd_pass
  sysorg               = "my-org"
  auth_type            = "saml_adfs"
  # If `saml_adfs_rpt_id` is not specified - VCD SAML Entity ID will be used automatically
  saml_adfs_rpt_id     = "my-custom-rpt-id"
  org                  = var.vcd_org                  # Default for resources
  vdc                  = var.vcd_vdc                  # Default for resources
  url                  = var.vcd_url
  max_retry_timeout    = var.vcd_max_retry_timeout
  allow_unverified_ssl = var.vcd_allow_unverified_ssl
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are used to configure the VMware Cloud Director Provider:

* `user` - (Required) This is the username for Cloud Director API operations. Can also be specified
  with the `VCD_USER` environment variable. *v2.0+* `user` may be "administrator" (set `org` or
  `sysorg` to "System" in this case). 
  *v2.9+* When using with SAML and ADFS - username format must be in Active Directory format -
  `user@contoso.com` or `contoso.com\user` in combination with `use_saml_adfs` option.
  
* `password` - (Required) This is the password for Cloud Director API operations. Can
  also be specified with the `VCD_PASSWORD` environment variable.

* `auth_type` - (Optional) `integrated`, `token` or `saml_adfs`. Default is `integrated`.
  * `integrated` - VCD local users and LDAP users (provided LDAP is configured for Organization).
  * `saml_adfs` allows to use SAML login flow with Active Directory Federation
  Services (ADFS) using "/adfs/services/trust/13/usernamemixed" endpoint. Please note that
  credentials for ADFS should be formatted as `user@contoso.com` or `contoso.com\user`. Can also be
  set with `VCD_AUTH_TYPE` environment variable.
  * `token` allows to specify token in [`token`](#token) field.
  
* `token` - (Optional; *v2.6+*) This is the token that can be used instead of username
   and password (in combination with field `auth_type=token`). When this is set, username and
   password will be ignored, but should be left in configuration either empty or with any custom
   values. A token can be specified with the `VCD_TOKEN` environment variable.
   Both a (deprecated) authorization token or a bearer token (*v3.1+*) can be used in this field.

* `saml_adfs_rpt_id` - (Optional) When using `auth_type=saml_adfs` VCD SAML entity ID will be used
  as Relaying Party Trust Identifier (RPT ID) by default. If a different RPT ID is needed - one can
  set it using this field. It can also be set with `VCD_SAML_ADFS_RPT_ID` environment variable.

* `org` - (Required) This is the Cloud Director Org on which to run API
  operations. Can also be specified with the `VCD_ORG` environment
  variable.  
  *v2.0+* `org` may be set to "System" when connection as Sys Admin is desired
  (set `user` to "administrator" in this case).  
  Note: `org` value is case sensitive.
  
* `sysorg` - (Optional; *v2.0+*) - Organization for user authentication. Can also be
   specified with the `VCD_SYS_ORG` environment variable. Set `sysorg` to "System" and
   `user` to "administrator" to free up `org` argument for setting a default organization
   for resources to use.
   
* `url` - (Required) This is the URL for the Cloud Director API endpoint. e.g.
  https://server.domain.com/api. Can also be specified with the `VCD_URL` environment variable.
  
* `vdc` - (Optional) This is the virtual datacenter within Cloud Director to run
  API operations against. If not set the plugin will select the first virtual
  datacenter available to your Org. Can also be specified with the `VCD_VDC` environment
  variable.
  
* `max_retry_timeout` - (Optional) This provides you with the ability to specify the maximum
  amount of time (in seconds) you are prepared to wait for interactions on resources managed
  by Cloud Director to be successful. If a resource action fails, the action will be retried
  (as long as it is still within the `max_retry_timeout` value) to try and ensure success.
  Defaults to 60 seconds if not set.
  Can also be specified with the `VCD_MAX_RETRY_TIMEOUT` environment variable.
  
* `maxRetryTimeout` - (Deprecated) Use `max_retry_timeout` instead.

* `allow_unverified_ssl` - (Optional) Boolean that can be set to true to
  disable SSL certificate verification. This should be used with care as it
  could allow an attacker to intercept your auth token. If omitted, default
  value is false. Can also be specified with the
  `VCD_ALLOW_UNVERIFIED_SSL` environment variable.

* `logging` - (Optional; *v2.0+*) Boolean that enables API calls logging from upstream library `go-vcloud-director`. 
   The logging file will record all API requests and responses, plus some debug information that is part of this 
   provider. Logging can also be activated using the `VCD_API_LOGGING` environment variable.

* `logging_file` - (Optional; *v2.0+*) The name of the log file (when `logging` is enabled). By default is 
  `go-vcloud-director` and it can also be changed using the `VCD_API_LOGGING_FILE` environment variable.
  
* `import_separator` - (Optional; *v2.5+*) The string to be used as separator with `terraform import`. By default
  it is a dot (`.`).

## Connection Cache (*2.0+*)

Cloud Director connection calls can be expensive, and if a definition file contains several resources, it may trigger 
multiple connections. There is a cache engine, disabled by default, which can be activated by the `VCD_CACHE` 
environment variable. When enabled, the provider will not reconnect, but reuse an active connection for up to 20 
minutes, and then connect again.
