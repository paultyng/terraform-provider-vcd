# vcd\_vapp\_vm

Provides a vCloud Director VM resource. This can be used to create,
modify, and delete VMs within a vApp.

~> **Note:** To make sure resources are created in the right order and both plan apply and destroy succeeds, use the `depends_on` clause (see example below)


## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "vcd_network_direct" "net" {
  name             = "net"
  external_network = "corp-network"
}

resource "vcd_vapp" "web" {
  name = "web"

  depends_on = ["vcd_network_direct.net"]
}

resource "vcd_vapp_vm" "web1" {
  vapp_name     = "${vcd_vapp.web.name}"
  name          = "web1"
  catalog_name  = "Boxes"
  template_name = "lampstack-1.10.1-ubuntu-10.04"
  memory        = 2048
  cpus          = 2
  cpu_cores     = 1

  network_name = "net"
  ip           = "10.10.104.161"

  depends_on = ["vcd_vapp.web"]
}

resource "vcd_vapp_vm" "web2" {
  vapp_name     = "${vcd_vapp.web.name}"
  name          = "web2"
  catalog_name  = "Boxes"
  template_name = "lampstack-1.10.1-ubuntu-10.04"
  memory        = 2048
  cpus          = 1

  network_name = "net"
  ip           = "10.10.104.162"
  
  disk {
    name = "logDisk1"
    bus_number = 1
    unit_number = 0
  }
  
  disk {
    name = "logDisk2"
    bus_number = 1
    unit_number = 1
  }  

  depends_on = ["vcd_vapp.web"]
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `vapp_name` - (Required) The vApp this VM should belong to.
* `name` - (Required) A unique name for the VM
* `catalog_name` - (Required) The catalog name in which to find the given vApp Template
* `template_name` - (Required) The name of the vApp Template to use
* `memory` - (Optional) The amount of RAM (in MB) to allocate to the VM
* `cpus` - (Optional) The number of virtual CPUs to allocate to the VM. Socket count is a result of: virtual logical processors/cores per socket
* `cpu_cores` - (Optional; *v2.1+*) The number of cores per socket
* `initscript` (Optional) A script to be run only on initial boot
* `network_name` - (Optional) Name of the network this VM should connect to
* `vapp_network_name` - (Optional; *v2.1+*) Name of the vApp network this VM should connect to
* `ip` - (Optional) The IP to assign to this vApp. Must be an IP address or
  one of dhcp, allocated or none. If given the address must be within the
  `static_ip_pool` set for the network. If left blank, and the network has
  `dhcp_pool` set with at least one available IP then this will be set with
  DHCP.
* `power_on` - (Optional) A boolean value stating if this vApp should be powered on. Default is `true`
* `accept_all_eulas` - (Optional; *v2.0+*) Automatically accept EULA if OVA has it. Default is `true`
* `org` - (Optional; *v2.0+*) The name of organization to use, optional if defined at provider level. Useful when connected as sysadmin working across different organisations
* `vdc` - (Optional; *v2.0+*) The name of VDC to use, optional if defined at provider level
* `disk` - (Optional; *v2.1+*) Independent disk attachment configuration. Details below

Independent disk support the following attributes:

* `name` - (Required) Independent disk name
* `bus_number` - (Required) Bus number on which to place the disk controller
* `unit_number` - (Required) Unit number (slot) on the bus specified by BusNumber.
