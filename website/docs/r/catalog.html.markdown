# vcd\_catalog

Provides a VMware Cloud Director catalog resource. This can be used to create and delete a catalog.

Supported in provider *v2.0+*

## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "vcd_catalog" "myNewCatalog" {
  org = "my-org"

  name             = "my-catalog"
  description      = "catalog for files"
  delete_recursive = "true"
  delete_force     = "true"
}
```

## Example Usage (Custom storage profile)

```hcl

data "vcd_storage_profile" "sp1" {
  org  = "my-org"
  vdc  = "my-vdc"
  name = "ssd-storage-profile"
}

resource "vcd_catalog" "myNewCatalog" {
  org = "my-org"

  name               = "my-catalog"
  description        = "catalog for files"
  storage_profile_id = data.vcd_storage_profile.sp1.id

  delete_recursive = "true"
  delete_force     = "true"
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `org` - (Optional) The name of organization to use, optional if defined at provider level. Useful when connected as sysadmin working across different organisations
* `name` - (Required) Catalog name
* `description` - (Optional) - Description of catalog
* `storage_profile_id` (Optional, *v3.1+*) Allows to set specific storage profile to be used for catalog. **Note.** Data
source [vcd_storage_profile](/providers/vmware/vcd/latest/docs/data-sources/storage_profile.html) can help to lookup storage profile ID.
* `delete_recursive` - (Required) - When destroying use delete_recursive=True to remove the catalog and any objects it contains that are in a state that normally allows removal
* `delete_force` -(Required) - When destroying use delete_force=True with delete_recursive=True to remove a catalog and any objects it contains, regardless of their state

## Importing

~> **Note:** The current implementation of Terraform import can only import resources into the state. It does not generate
configuration. [More information.][docs-import]

An existing catalog can be [imported][docs-import] into this resource via supplying the full dot separated path for a
catalog. For example, using this structure, representing an existing catalog that was **not** created using Terraform:

```hcl
resource "vcd_catalog" "my-catalog" {
  org              = "my-org"
  name             = "my-catalog"
  delete_recursive = "true"
  delete_force     = "true"
}
```

You can import such catalog into terraform state using this command

```bash
terraform import vcd_catalog.my-catalog my-org.my-catalog
```

NOTE: the default separator (.) can be changed using Provider.import_separator or variable VCD_IMPORT_SEPARATOR

[docs-import]:https://www.terraform.io/docs/import/

After that, you can expand the configuration file and either update or delete the catalog as needed. Running `terraform plan`
at this stage will show the difference between the minimal configuration file and the catalog's stored properties.
