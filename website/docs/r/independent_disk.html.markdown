# vcd\_independent\_disk

Provides a VMware Cloud Director independent disk resource. This can be used to create and delete independent disks.
Resource is capable to update independent disk attached to VM in case VM is power off. Update detaches temporarily
disks and attach back after changes are done.

## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "vcd_independent_disk" "myNewIndependentDisk" {
  vdc             = "my-vcd"
  name            = "logDisk"
  size_in_mb      = "1024"
  bus_type        = "SCSI"
  bus_sub_type    = "VirtualSCSI"
  storage_profile = "external"
}

resource "vcd_vapp_vm" "web2" {
  vapp_name = vcd_vapp.web.name

  # ...

  disk {
    name        = vcd_independent_disk.myNewIndependentDisk.name
    bus_number  = 1
    unit_number = 0
  }

}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `org` - (Optional) The name of organization to use, optional if defined at provider level. Useful when connected as sysadmin working across different organisations
* `vdc` - (Optional) The name of VDC to use, optional if defined at provider level
* `name` - (Required) Disk name
* `size_in_mb` - (Required, *v3.0+*) Size of disk in MB.
* `bus_type` - (Optional) Disk bus type. Values can be: `IDE`, `SCSI`, `SATA`, (*v3.6+*) `NVME` 
* `bus_sub_type` - (Optional) Disk bus subtype. Values can be: `buslogic`, `lsilogic`, `lsilogicsas`, `VirtualSCSI` for `SCSI`, `ahci` for `SATA` and (*v3.6+*) `nvmecontroller` for `NVME`
* `storage_profile` - (Optional) The name of storage profile where disk will be created
* `sharing_type` - (Optional, *v3.6+* and VCD 10.2+) This is the sharing type. Values can be: `DiskSharing`,`ControllerSharing`"

## Attribute reference

Supported in provider *v2.5+*

* `iops` - (Computed) IOPS request for the created disk
* `owner_name` - (Computed) The owner name of the disk
* `datastore_name` - (Computed) Data store name. Readable only for system user.
* `is_attached` - (Computed) True if the disk is already attached
* `encrypted` - (Computed, *v3.6+* and VCD 10.2+) True if disk is encrypted
* `uuid` - (Computed, *v3.6+* and VCD 10.2+) The UUID of this named disk's device backing

## Importing

Supported in provider *v2.5+*

~> **Note:** The current implementation of Terraform import can only import resources into the state. It does not generate
configuration. [More information.][docs-import]

An existing independent disk can be [imported][docs-import] into this resource via supplying its path.
The path for this resource is made of org-name.vdc-name.disk-id
For example, using this structure, representing a independent disk that was **not** created using Terraform:

```hcl
resource "vcd_independent_disk" "tf-myDisk" {
  vdc  = "my-vdc"
  name = "my-disk"
}
```

You can import such independent disk into terraform state using this command

```
terraform import vcd_independent_disk.tf-myDisk org-name.vdc-name.my-disk-id
```

[docs-import]:https://www.terraform.io/docs/import/

After importing, if you run `terraform plan` you will see the rest of the values and modify the script accordingly for
further operations.

### Listing independent disk IDs

If you want to list IDs there is a special command **`terraform import vcd_independent_disk.imported list@org-name.vdc-name.my-independent-disk-name`**
or **`terraform import vcd_independent_disk.imported list@org-name.vdc-name`**
where `org-name` is the organization used, `vdc-name` is vDC name and `my-independent-disk-name`
is independent disk name. The output for this command should look similar to the one below:

```shell
$ terraform import vcd_independent_disk.imported list@org-name.vdc-name.my-independent-disk-name
vcd_independent_disk.Disk_import: Importing from ID "list@org-name.vdc-name.my-independent-disk-name"...
Retrieving all disks by name
No  ID                                                      Name    Description Size
--  --                                                      ----    ------      ----
1  urn:vcloud:disk:1bbc273d-7701-4f06-97be-428b46b0805e     diskV2  loging      78946548
2  urn:vcloud:disk:6e1c996f-48b8-4e78-8111-a6407188d8b6     diskV2              5557452

Error: resource was not imported! resource id must be specified in one of these formats:
'org-name.vdc-name.my-independent-disk-id' to import by rule id
'list@org-name.vdc-name.my-independent-disk-name' to get a list of disks with their IDs
```

Now to import disk with ID urn:vcloud:disk:1bbc273d-7701-4f06-97be-428b46b0805e one could supply this command:

```shell
$ terraform import vcd_independent_disk.imported list@org-name.vdc-name.urn:vcloud:disk:1bbc273d-7701-4f06-97be-428b46b0805e
```
