## Importing

Supported in provider *v2.5+*

~> **Note:** The current implementation of Terraform import can only import resources into the state. It does not generate
configuration. [More information.][docs-import]

An existing media item can be [imported][docs-import] into this resource via supplying its path.
The path for this resource is made of org-name.catalog-name.media-name
For example, using this structure, representing a media item that was **not** created using Terraform:

```hcl
resource "vcd_catalog_media" "tf-mymedia" {
  org     = "my-org"
  catalog = "my-catalog"
  name    = "my-media"
}
```

You can import such catalog media into terraform state using this command

```
terraform import vcd_catalog_media.tf-mymedia my-org.my-catalog.my-media
```

[docs-import]:https://www.terraform.io/docs/import/

After importing, if you run `terraform plan` you will see the rest of the values and modify the script accordingly for
further operations.
